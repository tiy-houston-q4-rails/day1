  puts "Hello World"

We can assign values to variables using `=`

  message = "Hello World"
  puts message

Is a dynamic language meaning we can assign any value to any variables

  message = "Hello World"
  message = 35

  names = ["Kevin", "Kirk", "Astrid"]
  names[0] # Kevin
  names[2] # Astrid

A hash is a collection of values that you access using keys

  person = { :name => "Dwight", :age => 28, "favorite_movie" => "Hook" }
  person[:name] # "Dwight"
  person[:age] # 28
  person["favorite_movie"] # "Hook"
